## General Information

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Prepared 3 models out of which only 1 was successfull (last model)
- Model 3 accuracy has increased between training and Validation
- Class has rebalanced which helped in achieving the training and validation accuracy
- Overfitting issue is resolved
